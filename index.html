            A sample refers to a smaller, manageable version of a larger group.
            It is a subset containing the characteristics of a larger
            population. Samples are used in statistical testing when population
            sizes are too large for the test to include all possible members or
            observations. A sample should represent the population as a whole
            and not reflect any bias toward a specific attribute.
